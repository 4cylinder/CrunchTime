# CrunchTime
A side project I made to practice Android development.

This app has alternate layouts for portrait and landscape modes.

It allows users to enter a calorie-burning goal, and outputs suggestions for different exercises  one can do to achieve that goal.

It also allows users to calculate how many calories they have burned after entering the quantity of a specific exercise.
